    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the compound annual growth rate<br> 
    What is the compound annual growth rate?<br>
    The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the rate of reutnr that is required for an investment to change from it's beginning balance to it's ending balance, taking the assumption that the profits are reinvested at the end of each period of the investment's life span.<br>
    How to calculate compound annual growth rate?<br>
    To calculate compound annual growth rate you should use the following formula:<br>
    compound annual growth rate = ((EV / BV)^1/h - 1) * 100<br>
    where:<br>
    EV = ending value<br>
    BV = beginning value<br>
    n = number of years<br>
    Example: company x has a revenue that grew from $50,000 to $1,000,000 in a period of 5 years, calculate the compound annual growth rate?<br>
    Using the compound annual growth rate the answer will be:<br>
    compound annual growth rate = ((EV / BV)^1/h - 1) * 100<br>
    compound annual growth rate = (($1,000,000 / $50,000)^1/5 - 1) * 100<br>
    compound annual growth rate = 82.05%<br>
    Why use compound annual growth rate?<br>
    The compound annual growth rate is used to evaluate how different investments have performed over a specific period of time> It is also used in fixing the limitations of the arithmetic average return.<br>
